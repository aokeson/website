I am an industry data scientist/research engineer with expertise in exploring, understanding, and improving how people use machine learning and data analytics to better interpret information and make decisions based on data. Previously, I completed my PhD in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington advised by [James Fogarty](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/).
