I am a fourth year PhD student advised by [James Fogarty](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/) in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I research how to use **machine learning** and **data analytics** to help people better **understand** and **make decisions** based on data, particularly within healthcare contexts.

During the summer of 2021 I will be interning at [Google Health](https://health.google/).
